1.03

2017/04/30 1.03:  #1. Added CHECK_RESULT step to Graph Database update.
                  #2. Handle case where source and destination nodes for an edge
		      differs between the Graph and the update RF2.  Remove
		      such edges and fail the update -- requiring a 2nd pass which adds them
		      with the new source and destination and completes the update.
	
		      NOTE: it is not possible to repoint the source or destination of
		            an edge in NEO4J 3.0.  Removal and re-addition of the edge is required.

		      The plan is to later detect this in the graph vs RF2
		      comparison and perform the same edge removal and re-add,
		      but in a single pass instead of 2 passes.
